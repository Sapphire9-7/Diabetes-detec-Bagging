# Diabetes-detec-Bagging
An ensemble machine learning model (Bagging) to predict diabetes based on different features.

# Model
First, a sole decision tree model was used then this decision tree model was used to train a bagging model with default parameters.GridSearchCV was used to determine the best model parameters, then the best parameters are used to fit the bagging model again. The model is evaluated on training, evaluation, and testing datasets.
